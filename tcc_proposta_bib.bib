abstract = "Collision prevention is critical for navigation safety at sea. At early ages, researchers aimed at developing navigational assistance systems for enhancing situational awareness of human operators as human is at the core of collision avoidance. Recently, autonomous vehicles have gained a remarkable amount of attention with a focus on solving collision problems by machines. This results in two groups of studies, both working on preventing collisions but with different focuses: one aims at conflict detection, and the other focuses on conflict resolution. This paper offers a comprehensive overview of collision prevention techniques based on the three basic processes of determining evasive solutions, namely, motion prediction, conflict detection, and conflict resolution. The strengths and weaknesses of different methods for these three fundamental processes are discussed. Limitations and new challenges are highlighted. Moreover, this review points out the differences between the research for manned and unmanned ships and how the research in the two domains can learn from each other. A potential roadmap for the transition from existing manned ships to fully unmanned ships is provided in the end."

abstract = "With growing worldwide interest in commercial, scientific, and military issues associated with both oceans and shallow waters, there has been a corresponding growth in demand for the development of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) with advanced guidance, navigation and control (GNC) capabilities. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review of recent progress in USVs development. The paper first provides an overview of both historical and recent USVs development, along with some fundamental definitions. Next, existing USVs GNC approaches are outlined and classified according to various criteria, such as their applications, methodologies, and challenges. Finally, more general challenges and future directions of USVs towards more practical GNC capabilities are highlighted."

abstract = "Numerous methods have been developed for ship collision prevention over the past decades. However, most studies are based on strong assumptions, such as the need for a constant velocity of the target-ship, the limitation to two-ship scenarios, the simplification of ships' dynamics, etc. Generalized Velocity Obstacle (GVO) algorithm can bridge these gaps. This paper presents a GVO algorithm for ship collision avoidance and designs a collision avoidance system (GVO-CAS). The proposed system visualizes the changes of one ship's course and speed resulting in collisions, which can be used not only for supporting the officer on watch to prevent collisions, but also for collision prevention of Autonomous Surface Vessels (ASVs) and for human operators taking over the control of ASVs. Simulation experiments show that the proposed collision avoidance system can work properly in various maritime environments. Compared to the original Velocity Obstacle algorithm, the GVO algorithm is more reliable and suitable for close range ship collision avoidance. Moreover, the GVO-CAS can offer rule-compliant evasive actions with a minimum number of required actions for ships. These results show the great potential to use the GVO algorithm in both manned and unmanned ships at sea."

abstract = "The unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are required to perform a dynamic obstacle avoidance during a task. This is essential for USV safety in case of an emergency and this work has been proved to be difficult. However, little research has been done in this area. This paper focuses on an obstacle avoidance problem where the USVs are confronted with a moving ship. A two-level dynamic obstacle avoidance algorithm is introduced by combining the velocity obstacle (VO) algorithm with the improved artificial potential field (APF) method in a non-emergency situation, by using the VO algorithms to establish the velocity vector relationship between the USV and obstacles, both the obstacle avoidance and the goal approaching are considered. During an emergency, a compound potential field is formed around the obstacles. The field is composed of a repulsive potential field and a centrifugal potential field. Under its influence, only the collision avoidance is considered to ensure safety. Finally, numerical simulations are performed with the help of the particle swarm optimisation (PSO) method in order to improve the computational efficiency and accuracy. The results validated the feasibility and validity of the two-level dynamic obstacle avoidance algorithm."
